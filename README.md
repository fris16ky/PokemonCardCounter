# Reason
I have had a particular in Trading Card games since I was very young. I gave it all up, but recently got back into it around COVID, although I was always interested. 

# How does it work?
For a specific TCG, Pokemon, I record every single card that I pull or buy in a WordPad file. Essentially, this code just sums up all of the numerical values that I wrote down. 
Recently, I updated it to keep separate sums for each generation (essentially, every brand new game released every 5 years or so) for a more detailed output, and to me, a more intriguing one. 
For more specifics, I keep track of each type of card (whether it's normal, a holographic, a special/tournament card, etc.); the code sums it up all the same. 

# Technology Used
This project is written in C# on Visual Studio 2022. It's built on a .NET Windows Form App, although for now it's just a simple button to upload a text file (via OpenFileDialog). 
I plan to add some personalization to make the output more visually appealing than a plain text box response. I also plan on making the code better fitting for the future and more efficient; it's rather rough/rigid currently.
